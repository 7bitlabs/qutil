VERSION 2.0 -- 2009.09.09
* Significantly enhanced functionality of option parser.  Breaks backwards compatibility
** New .utl.addDefOpt allows a default value to be specified for an option
** New .utl.addArg allows positional arguments to be specified
** NONCOMPATIBLE - Options and arguments must now be finalized by calling .utl.parseArgs with an optional string value
*** Any command line arguments that are not handled will cause an error to be raised.
*** If the command line fails, a detailed description of the command line and available options will be printed
* Fixed bug with config file parser where empty lines would cause the parser to fail an error to be raised.  Empty lines (blank or only white-space) are now ignored

VERSION 1.1 -- 2009.07.24
* Made loader capable of handling nested packages more robustly
* Made loader capable of detecting conflicting required package versions

VERSION 1.0 -- 2009.07.22
* NONCOMPATIBLE - Changed package-name/version number separator from '.' to '-'
* Fixed bug where some version numbers would be incorrectly seen as larger (ie: 1.11 was greater than 2.0)
* Added init.q file to qutil library, does *not* load bootstrap.q
* Added config_parse code to parse INI style files (should be able to parse same files as Python's ConfigParser module)

VERSION 0.1 -- 2009.05.25
* Initial Version
