== ABOUT ==

qutil provides several different common utility
functionalities for use with Q programs.  These currently include:

* an option parsing facility as an alternative to .Q.opt
* a file loading facility based on a pathlist and supporting
  version numbers

== INSTALLATION == 

Unzip qutil to whichever location you desire.

If you plan on using the file loading facility you must add
the code in q.q to your Q installation's q.q

You can customize the environment variable used for the library
search path by changing the argument passed to that function
(it defaults to $QPATH). The environment variable can also
refer to multiple paths by separating them with colons.

Next, place or link the file qutil/lib/bootstrap.q into the path
specified by the environment variable used in q.q

As an example, if you have used the enviornment variable
QPATH and set QPATH to /home/user/qpath, with the qutil
project residing in /home/user/qpackages, you would want to
have a directory layout for /home/user/qpath alont these
lines:

/home/user/qpath/bootstrap.q -> /home/user/qpackages/qutil/lib/bootstrap.q
/home/user/qpath/qutil -> /home/user/qpackages/qutil/lib

You should also move or symlink qutil/lib into this path so
that it can be references by the code loading utility
functions.

Doing all this will cause the file qutil/lib/bootstrap.q to
be loaded and will expose the file loading functions. The
qutil library will also be exposed to the .utl.require and
.utl.load functions (such as .utl.load "qutil").

== MISC ==

While you are under no obligation to do so, if you have
changes to the code that you feel would be useful to others,
please contribute them back.  If you have suggestions,
please make them.  If you have found a bug, please report
it.

To run the tests in test_require, explicitly pass the test
files to the qspec runner.  This is because executable q
files were needed to properly test the code loading capacities
and the qspec runner tries to inadvertently load these files.
